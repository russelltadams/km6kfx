## Welcome to the radio blog of km6kfx

I was going to use this blog to log my contacts as well as save any radio settings,
documentation or code produced while using my radio... but my radio got stolen. 

### Radio

I use to had a [Wouxun KG-UV3D](https://powerwerx.com/wouxun-kguv3d-handheld-amateur-radio). It was super fun, durable and easy to use. I can recommend it as a nice starter hand-held HAM radio for UHF/VHF. Here's the frequency and power specs.

```yaml
KG-UV3D:
  VHF:
    TX: 144-148 MHz
    RX: 136-174 MHz
    Power:
      High: 5W
      Low: 1W
  UHF:
    TX: 420-450 MHz
    RX: 420-520 MHz
    Power:
      High: 4W
      Low: 1W
```
The KG-UV3D can listen on two UHF or VHF frequencies, or
one of each. It can transmit on one while listening on both
and it has convenient button on the front for switching to
"a/b" mode and switching which frequency you want to transmit
on. Easy.

### Wish List
- I'd like to get a scanner, the KG-UVD3 doesn't scan that
well, and well, thats not really what it is for. That said, especially when I am traveling, it would be nice to have a
hand held scanner.
- I'd love to have an antenna on my roof. Even if just a place to stick my hand made copper J-pole.
- More time to mess around with HAM radio.
