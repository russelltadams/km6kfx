### Radio

I currently have only a [Wouxun KG-UV3D](https://powerwerx.com/wouxun-kguv3d-handheld-amateur-radio), but the thing has been super fun, durable and
easy to use. I can recommend it as a nice starter hand-held
HAM radio for UHF/VHF. Here's the frequency and power specs.

```yaml
VHF:
  TX: 144-148MHz
  RX: 136-174MHz
    Power: 5W/1W
UHF:
  TX: 420-450MHz
  RX: 420-520MHz
    Power: 4W/1W
```
The KG-UV3D can listen on two UHF or VHF frequencies, or
one of each. It can transmit on one while listening on both
and it has convenient button on the front for switching to
"a/b" mode and switching which frequency you want to transmit
on. Easy.

### Wish List
- I'd like to get a scanner, the KG-UVD3 doesn't scan that
well, and well, thats not really what it is for. That said, especially when I am traveling, it would be nice to have a
hand held scanner.
- I'd love to have an antenna on my roof. Even if just a place to stick my hand made copper J-pole.
- More time to mess around with HAM radio.
